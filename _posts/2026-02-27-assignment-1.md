## Introduction

Fanfiction is often described as individualized transformative work, because it makes authors reimagine the source material by expanding it through their own personal lens. However, many fanfictions remain closely embedded within the worlds they rework, even if they tend to focus more on certain aspects or characters from the original work. Rather than asking whether fanfiction diverges from J.K. Rowling’s original series, I became more interested in the question: what does fanfiction choose to center?

To explore this, I analyzed two canonical novels: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, which is the first book in the Harry Potter series, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the very last book in the series. These texts structure the beginning and end of the original narrative, which allows me to observe broader structural patterns.

I analyzed these novels alongside three fanfiction texts: Hogwarts Rejection Letters by Sweet_Kagamine_Kiss, Professor MortlDove by Khartoum_5, and And I Will Find You by lyingleia. Based on some of the background research I have done, I would conclude that each of these fanfictions reimagines the wizarding world in distinct ways: Hogwarts Rejection Letters is about failed Hogwarts admissions, Professor MortlDove introduces a newly appointed Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, and And I Will Find You is an alternate universe (AU) narrative that is set in New York University (NYU), which removes the characters completely from the magical world.

Across these texts, I began to notice that fanfiction does not simply change the contents from canon; fanfiction selectively recenters certain elements and minimizes others. The pattern becomes evident when we look at who dominates the narrative, what types of vocabulary appear most frequently, and how densely the magical world itself is represented. This approach reminds me of  Ted Underwood’s discussion in Distant Horizons about the value and risk of distant reading. While computational tools display patterns of frequency and distribution of words across multiple texts, Underwood warns us that these patterns require careful human interpretation, rather than making mindless conclusions. Similarly, Geoffrey Rockwell, Stéfan Sinclair in Hermeneutica argue that computer-assisted analysis does not replace interpretation, but that it rather makes us rethink the questions we ask of texts. My use of these visualizations does not function as a substitute of close reading, but as a way of identifying patterns that I interpret within their narrative contexts.


Note: For corpus analysis, these texts were uploaded using their original file names, which appear in the visualizations I displayed. However, I refer to them throughout this essay by their title names.

## Character Centrality: Who Dominates the Narrative?

The first visualization was generated by using Posit Cloud, and I decided to create a heatmap of major character name frequencies across all five texts. I selected characters who appeared a lot throughout the series such as Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Draco, as well as some of these characters’ last names and others to measure character focalization.

*Figure 1: Frequency of character names across texts.*

In the canonical novels, especially Deathly Hallows, the distribution of characters is very centralized. Harry dominates the text, followed closely by Hermione and Ron; authority figures and antagonists also maintain a consistent presence in the original stories. However, the fanfictions show something different. 

In Professor MortlDove, Harry’s presence is noticeably reduced compared to canon because the narrative places more attention toward institutional figures, particularly a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor; this aligns with the fanfiction’s premise. The story in Hogwarts remains, but the focal lens shifts from the students’ heroism to this new authority that was introduced; the world stays the same, but the central focus moves.

In And I Will Find You, the change becomes even more noticeable as the names of several canonical authority figures disappear entirely. The important institutional figures in Rowling’s novels do not appear here at all. The only names that show up are Harry’s, Hermione’s, and Granger, which is Hermione’s surname, yet the story is still recognizable as Harry Potter fanfiction. That story is likely maintained through character development and relational dynamics. Canon relies on a stable network, while fanfiction redistributes the weight of the narrative depending on the goals of the authors from each text. This heatmap primarily reveals the variation in emphasis and centralization of characters across all texts. 

## Institutional Vs Relational Vocabulary

My second visualization was created on Voyant Tools where I chose to compare two broad vocabulary categories: institutional terms (from canon texts) and relational language. I selected words associated with Hogwarts, professors, magical objects, and wizarding infrastructure, alongside words that relate to personal connections between individuals.

*Figure 2: Comparison of institutional vs relational terms.*

Before running this analysis, I expected the canonical novels, particularly Deathly Hallows given its wartime setting, to overwhelmingly dominate in magical vocabulary. While canon does show strong institutional density, some of the results challenged my assumptions. 

The first thing I noticed was in the Professor MortlDove text, where the frequency of the word “professor” is dramatically high compared to the others. This aligns with background research on the fanfiction’s premise, which centers it around a new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor. The institutional focus here differs from canon because it concentrates on the new professor. Other institutional vocabulary such as “headmaster” or “school” appears far less frequently, and the word “ministry” doesn’t appear at all.

One surprising result involved the use of the term “wand.” I initially assumed that Deathly Hallows would easily bypass all the fanfictions and have the highest usage of the word “wand” because of the large number of battles and duels in the last book. However, the difference wasn’t as extreme as I expected; the use of the word “professor” in the Professor MortlDove  fanfiction clearly outshines it. This made me reconsider my assumption that wand usage primarily signals conflict and instead suggested that magical objects are in fact part of the ordinary structure of the wizarding world. As a result, fanfiction doesn’t need to replicate climactic battles to remain connected to canon; it can preserve elements from the wizarding world of Harry Potter, and at the same time shift the focus of the narrative around different characters or institutional roles.

In contrast, the relational vocabulary appears more concentrated in the fanfiction texts than in the canonical novels. Words associated with personal bonds and emotional attachment show a noticeable presence, especially in And I Will Find You. Given that this fanfiction removes the characters from the magical world entirely and relocates them to NYU, its increase in relational language makes sense. Without the institutional structure of Hogwarts or the wizarding world itself, the story sustains its connection to canon through character relationships. Overall, fanfiction does not diverge from the original world, it just changes the emphasis on certain aspects. 

## Magical Terminology from Canon

The third visualization tracks the distribution of magical terms across each text using Voyant’s Bubblelines tool. The Bubblelines tool displays how these words are distributed throughout each narrative instead of merely showing their frequencies.

*Figure 3: Distribution of Magical Harry Potter Terminology across texts.*

My goal here was to see just how different the use of words relating to fantasy and magic are in fanfiction texts. As seen on the figure, magical terminology is consistently saturated across the canonical novels; words associated with Hogwarts, wizardry, spells, and magical objects always appear throughout the narrative. 
	
In Hogwarts Rejection Letters, magical vocabulary remains present, which makes sense given the fanfiction’s premise, which is centered around the institution of Hogwarts. The recurring use of the words “wizard” and “witch” supports the idea that the narrative remains embedded within the educational structure of the wizarding world. Even though the fanfiction shifts its focus away from the heroic acts of the main characters, it maintains the structure of the series by keeping the school and the magical terminology at its core. 

In Professor MortlDove, magical terminology appears more sparingly, which shows its narrower narrative focus within the wizarding world. This fanfiction still has the basis of the canon’s universe, however, it is noticeably less saturated with fantasy vocabulary, which is likely because the story centers on the arrival of a new professor at Hogwarts rather than any magical conflict. After looking into the fanfiction more closely, I found that the new Professor, who is also Voldemort in disguise, deliberately chooses to ignore his role of teaching spells in Latin, and instead forces the students to master the spells in Arabic. This detail supports the text’s emphasis on institutional authority and pedagogical control rather than on the focus on magic and fantasy. Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the author chose to recenter the story around the school as an institution, rather than exploring the broader and fantastical wizarding world of Harry Potter. 

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that fanfiction selectively recenters elements of the original world depending on the author’s goals. Some texts maintain institutional structure while moving the focus away from Harry; others remove the magical world entirely and rely on relational factors. The visualizations demonstrate that even when the fantasy setting diminishes, structural traces of canon still remain through vocabulary patterns. 

At the same time, this project puts the spotlight on the methodological tension described in Underwood’s The Risks of Distant Reading. Frequency patterns alone cannot explain why authors make particular narrative choices; they only reveal where emphasis lies. Without contextual interpretation, the lower presence of magical terminology in Professor MortlDove, for example, could be misread as divergence from canon.

Ultimately, distant reading allowed me to see patterns I might not have otherwise noticed, but background research into the stories was necessary to understand what those patterns meant. Therefore, fanfiction is not defined by divergence from canon, but by how it chooses to organize its foundational structures.
